# Travelling Salesman Problem
 This repo contains code for completing the following problem:
 A salesman starts at New York and needs to visit every other city exactly once before ending back at New York.

We use a Beam Search Algorithm to solve this where the beam value is 2. The results of different beam values (2-1000) are displayed at the end of the code (Code.ipynb) file.
 Furthermore you will find the cities along with the distance matrix for this problem at the start of the code file.
